The Programmer's Lament

The code compiles, the code compiles,
But bugs still lurk in hidden files.
The code compiles, yet errors arise,
A constant struggle, a constant surprise.

The PROGRAMMER works, the programmer strives,
To find the flaws, to make it thrive.
The PRoGraMmer debugs, the programmer sighs,
As deadlines loom and frustration flies.

But hope remains, a flicker of light,
To conquer bugs and make things right.
The code compiles, the code compiles,
And slowly, slowly, the solution smiles.
